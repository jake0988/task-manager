# README

Task-manager is an app that allows a user to log in after creating a new user, or to log in through omniauth and github. The user has its own tasks with an optional goal associated with the tasks. The user can also join a group that has its own tasks associated with it. The group can have many users. Groups have one goal that the tasks are ostensibly aimed at achieving.
All tasks can be designated as completed and can also be commented on.
